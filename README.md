## Project Name:  Tax Bracket Calculator Application

### Course Title:
Web Application Development

### Assignment Date:

### Student Name:  
Raymond-Daniel Reyes

### Project Description:
For this assignment, the student was supposed to create a functioning Tax Bracket calculator.  In order to do this, the student had to use if/else statements to perform the tax calculations according to the filing status selected.  The student must also create a function that causes the taxable income, the tax estimate, and the tax bracket sections to clear and the filing status to reset to "Single" when the "Clear Calculator" button is pressed.  Much like the previous two assignments, the student will have to push the files into a respository on GitHub.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A function is defined as a related group of JavaScript statements that are executed as a single unit.  While identical to methods, functions are not associated with objects.
2. If, If/else, and switch statements are used to make outcomes to several decisions in a program.  For instance, in this assignment's tax calculator, the user must choose one out of four filing statuses.  The status he chooses determines the calculations made on the user's inputted taxable income.
3. An array is defined as a set of data represented by a single variable name.  This is similar to a categorization of bits of information; for example, you can have the name of the array as “Numbers” and the elements (data) in that array being various numbers such as 2, 5, 57, and 3.141592653589793.
